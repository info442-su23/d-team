Mission Statement: Inform people of opportunities to help the homeless population

Problem Statement: 

Seattle’s growing homeless population has been a topic of concern for years, with driving factors including mental illness, drug use, poverty, weather, and low-income mobility. In Seattle, at least 53,500 people experienced homelessness in 2022, a stark increase from 45,300 people during 2019, according to the King County Regional Homelessness Authority. The 2022 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) reported that more than 70% of this growth came from Seattle and King County. As of 2022, Washington is the fourth highest state in the U.S with the largest homeless population – a ranking that demands attention to address Seattle’s homelessness problem. 

The impacts of homelessness in Seattle can be seen by simply walking around downtown or driving along the highways that run through the city, where tents and makeshift shelters are visible on the sides of the road. ROOTS Young Adult Shelter reports that young adults experiencing homelessness have intensified health risks, as they are still developing physically, mentally, emotionally, and cognitively. The extreme stress along with the health risks homeless people face can lead to the use of drugs to cope with their difficult situations. Without any support, homeless people are significantly more likely to experience chronic homelessness, creating an endless cycle contributing to Seattle's homelessness problem. 

According to the UN, Europe and Northern America are driving the decline in the labor income share. Despite this decline, housing costs are seeing significant price increases. The Washington Office of Financial Management reports that within one year, home prices in Washington grew 23.9% from 2020 to 2021, and in the last decade, home costs more than doubled from $223,900 in 2011 to $560,400 in 2021. This increase in rental and housing costs, paired with a decline in labor income share, is said to be the major driver of the increase in homelessness statewide according to Tedd Kelleher, housing policy director for the Washington Department of Commerce. 

The City of Seattle’s policy framework for addressing homelessness is listed on their website as: person-centered service model, invest in programs that connect people to housing, and address racial disparities. Their Homeless Services System has three primary investment areas: prevention, emergency, and housing. While these are good ideas to work towards, they remain as ideas. The effects of these policies are not visible, nor do they address the root of the problem that was outlined in the previous paragraph. Encampments in the city have stayed in the same place for months, and the increase in Seattle’s homeless population each year shows that more needs to be done to help the homeless population – which should start with addressing the steadily increasing prices in the housing market.
